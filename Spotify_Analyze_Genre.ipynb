However, as visualized by the confusion matrix in the method 2 section, the model is fairly poor at predicting pop tracks successfully, yielding only a 48% accuracy compared to around 70% from Method #2. However, since it's more accurate in every other other genre, the overall accuracy is about the same. If the goal is to build a model that can take any 1 track, equally likely to be of any genre, this model will typically perform better.

Honestly, this is a pretty unusual song. I imagine if we allowed more genres, this may fall under some techno category, as it is certainly a mix of house and pop elements.

        "It seems that the best place to focus on for future improvement of the genre predicting model would be to improve the true labeling of the tracks. Detailed in part 1, every track / artist outputted by the Spotify API has a number of genre tags, but there is not a single definitive genre for one track. To allow us to build a genre-predicting algorithm, the track genre tags were pooled into a dictionary and I chose the most occuring gender to determine the True Genre for that track. This is somewhat imperfect and likely lead to some faulty labeling of true genre. However, this was the best option available until Spotify labels the genre of the track themselves, or I come up with some other NLP improvements for the tag text."
